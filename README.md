# Micro-lending Platform

## Concept

This is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate small crypto loans directly between users, particularly supporting those in need in developing countries. By eliminating intermediaries, this platform keeps transaction fees low, making micro-lending affordable and accessible.

## Impact

The platform empowers underserved communities by enabling access to financial resources that traditional institutions might not provide. It offers a way for people to fund small business ventures, cover emergencies, or meet essential needs, fostering financial inclusion and autonomy.
